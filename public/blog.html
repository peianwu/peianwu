					<p>Today I wanted to work with some images. I figured it's one of the reasons why web development is so amusing.</p>
					<p>So I made a picture of Earth in the center with a little stick figure starting at the top left corner of the screen. I guess it's him floating around in space, like the movie Gravity, which I saw earlier this week, and it was great! The little fella will be placed on the side of the planet that the mouse choose to hover over. It's a simple jQuery .on() method with css transformation to rotate the image depending on the side it's on.</p>
					<p>Yet, the most challenging part is the CSS layout of the four landing spots relative to the planet in the center. I'm using flexbox as my layout model so I wanted to append and remove elements without creating any visual shifts on the planet. That part took me the longest to figure out, but at the end I resorted to hard coding a default width for the left and right divs next to Earth. It worked, but feels like a cop-out. Oh well, better luck to me next time.</p>

					<p>This first project is rather simple, and it has to do with colors. Not very creative, I admit. The technique I'm trying to practice is some basic event handling and DOM manipulation using jQuery, something I knew but never had the chance to apply.<p>
					<p>Besides color setting, I also used JS to set the height of the grid cells based on window size, because I didn't want to hard code the height. The challenge in this exercise is establishing a proper JS code structure for calling the setCellHeight function. It just seems rather verbose to call the same function in multiple occasions. Also, will need to figure out why grid resize only responds to horizontal window resize.</p>
					<p>As a follow up would be to make the number dynamically generated.</p>

					<p>Today is October 4, 2013. Several months ago the aspiration to learn about programming finally broke out of me. I was an accounting major back in college, and for some reason that route never took off for me. So, I began to search for a suitable language as my first. Besides getting into programming, I knew exactly why I wanted to learn it: to develop my on web application. I used Google, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a>, <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>, and at the end, with all the information I gathered, I settled with <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.</p>
					<p>For the next couple weeks, I scoured the Internet for learning materials. I came across <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and plethora of tutorials contributed by other Pythonists. Each day, I'd work through the basics by following the instructions I found. Slowly, I became adept enough to write my own scripts to automate some of the things I do at a non-technical job. Yet, despite the accomplishment, I was still nowhere close to my ultimate goal.</p>
					<p>Today I witnessed Jennifer Dewalt's completion of her <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">project</a>, which was again featured on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6489468">HN</a>. I first learned about her endeavor when she just completed her 115th mini-project, also via HN. The whole process had been exceedingly inspirational, and all this made me realize that I must adopt the same <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jfdi">JFDI</a> mentality if I want to speed up my own learning. I figured there's no other way.<p>
					<p>Today, on October 4, 2013, I registered this domain on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">NameCheap.com</a> for a year, and deployed a static page on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> using <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. I figured I will give myself a year to put out as many projects as possible--5 per week as my bottom limit. I choose to start off with Node because it allows me to use a single language, JavaScript, for both front-end and back-end development. I realize that it won't be an easy path, since there's much to learn and explore as it's not as friendly for a beginner than, say, a more mature and "magical" frameworks like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. However, I believe by taking babysteps with JavaScript via the more visual front-end, I will eventually have garnered enough interest and experience to dive into the more abstract back-end without losing myself.<p>
					<p>Starting today, for the next year (in tribute to Jennifer's practical learning style, and as a continuation thereof), I will feature a mini-project each day, and hopefully in growing complexity as time goes on.</p>
					<p>And this is the end of Day 1.</p>
