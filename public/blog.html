				<p>Today is October 4, 2013. Several months ago the aspiration to learn about programming finally broke out of me. To start out, I began to search for a suitable language as my first. Besides getting into programming, I knew exactly why I wanted to learn it: to develop my on web application. I went through Google, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a>, <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>, and at the end I settled with <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.</p>
				<p>For the next couple weeks, I scoured the Internet for learning materials. I came across <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and plethora of tutorials contributed by other Pythonists. Each day, I'd work through the basics by following the instructions I found. Slowly, I became adept enough to write my own scripts to automate some of the things I do at a non-technical job. Yet, despite the accomplishment, I was still nowhere close to my ultimate goal.</p>
				<p>Today I witnessed Jennifer Dewalt's completion of her <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">project</a>, which was again featured on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6489468">HN</a>. I first learned about her endeavor when she just completed her 115th mini-project, also via HN. The whole process had been exceedingly inspirational, and all this made me realize that I must adopt the same <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jfdi">JFDI</a> mentality if I want to speed up my own learning. I figured there's no other way.<p>
				<p>Today, on October 4, 2013, I registered this domain on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">NameCheap.com</a> for a year, and deployed a static page on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> using <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. I figured I will give myself a year to put out as many projects as possible--5 per week as my bottom limit. I choose to start off with Node because it allows me to use a single language, JavaScript, for both front-end and back-end development. I realize that it won't be an easy path, since there's much to learn and explore as it's not as friendly for a beginner than, say, a more mature and "magical" frameworks like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. However, I believe by taking babysteps with JavaScript via the more visual front-end, I will eventually have garnered enough interest and experience to dive into the more abstract back-end without losing myself.<p>
				<p>Starting today, for the next year (in tribute to Jennifer's practical learning style, and as a continuation thereof), I will feature a mini-project each day, and hopefully in growing complexity as time goes on.</p>
				<p>And this is the end of Day 1.</p>
