	<p>Today is October 4, 2013. Several months ago the aspiration for to learn about programming was planted in me. It started off with choosing the right programming language. At that point, I knew exactly why I wanted to learn programming: to one day be able to develop my on web application. I Googled, I consulted the vibrant communities on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>, and at the end of the day they introduced me to <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.</p>
	<p>For the next couple weeks, I scoured the Internet for learning materials on Python. I came across <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and various tutorials contributed by the friendly Python community. Each day, with whatever free time during, or after, work, I'd be going through the basics of my new-found interest by following the instructions I found. Eventually I became adept enough to write my own Python scripts to automate some of the work I do at work, a non-computer related job. I was proud with the accomplishments. Yet, with all that progress, I am still nowhere close to my ultimate goal, which is to create a web app.</p>
	<p>One day I came across a <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">project</a> by Jennifer Dewalt that was featured on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6489468">HN</a>. It was very inspirational, and at the same time it made me realize I will probably never able to reach my goal if I don't adopt the same <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jfdi">JFDI</a> methodology.<p>
	<p>Today, on October 4, 2013, I registered this domain on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">NameCheap.com</a> for a year, and deployed a static page on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> using <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. I am choosing to use Node because it allows me to use a single language, JavaScript, for both front-end and back-end development. I realize that it won't be an easy path, since there's much to learn and explore as it's less beginner-friendly than, say, more mature and "magical" frameworks like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. However, I believe by taking babysteps from familiarizing myself with JavaScript via the more visual front-end, I will eventually have enough experience to dive into the more abstract back-end without losing myself.<p>
	<p>Starting today, for the next 181 days (in tribute to Jennifer and as a continuation thereof), I will create a page featuring something I learned that day, regardless how simple or complex.</p>
	<p>This is the end of Day 1</p>
